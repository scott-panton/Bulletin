You probably don't want to use this. It's very old and broken.

This is a fork of djcode's fork of cgoerner's Bulletin (http://sourceforge.net/projects/schoolreports)
It features:
* Less typos
* Auto-refresh
* Re-GPLed
* Other things

If you are upgrading from an older version make sure you copy across the new settings from config.php-dist otherwise stuff will probably break.
